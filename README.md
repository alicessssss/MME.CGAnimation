CG Animation (CGI)
</p>

<p>
Timeline：
Computer animation begin early in 1940s-1950s, so called computer graphics
</p>
<p>
Notable person John Whitney, however it was only in early 1960s that digital computers start to be well known. Before computer was mostly used for science experiments, engineering and research purposes.
</p>
<p>
By mid-1970s, gradually more and more improvements start to been made on public medias. 2D imagery was established, and as the improvement of computer, 3D realism become the next goal.
</p>
<p>
Late 1980s, photorealistic 3D start to appear in cinema movies
</p>
<p>
mid 1990s, at this tie 3D animation could be used for entire feature film production
Guiding questions:
</p>
<p>
Computer animation, was more well known as Computer Generated imagery(CGI), used for generation animated images. Including both static scenes and dynamic images. while computer animation only refers to the moving images. Modern computer animation usually uses 3D computer graphics, although 2D computer graphics are still used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster real-time renderings. Sometimes, the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes film as well.

John Whitney: American animator, composer and inventor. He and his brother James Whitney were so called fathers of computer animation. One of his well-known work in the early period was Alfred Hitchcock’s 1958 film Vertigo, where hi collaborated with graphic designer Saul Brass. He then established his company Motion Graphics Inc, focusing on production titles for film and television shows, and while also continuing further experiment too.

The First Programmable digital computer was SEAC (The standards Eastern Automatic Computer), computer pioneer Russel Kirsch and his team presented a drum scanner for SEAC, the usage was to trace variations of intensity over the surface of photographs, made the first digital image by scanning a photograph. The image, picturing Kirsch's three-month-old son, consisted of just 176×176 pixels. They used the computer to extract line drawings, count objects, recognize types of characters and display digital images on an oscilloscope screen.

Boeing Wichita 1960: Willian Fetter was a graphic designer, mainly work on developing ergonomic descriptions of human body and both accurate and adaptable to different environments, which leads to the first 3D animated figures, he called what he was working on as “Computer Graphics”.
</p>
<p>
Edward Zajac produced one of the first computer generated films in 1963 “A Two Gyro Gravity Gradient Attitude Control System”
</p>
<p>
1963: Ken Knowlton developed Beflix (Bell Flicks) animation system, use to produce artistic films by Stan Vanderbeek, Knowlton and Lillian Schwartz. Beflix worked using simple Graphic Primitives.
</p>
<p>
1965: Michael Noll Created computer-Generated stereographic 3D movies, and 1967 Noll used 4D animation technique produced computer animated title.

Animation Methods:
Traditional animation techniques: using frame by frame animation of 2D illustrations. Computer generated animation: more controllable than other physically based processes, construct miniatures for effects or creating scenes, and allows artist to produce content without use of actor, expensive equipment. To create illusion of movement, image will be displayed on the computer monitor and repeatedly replaced by a new image that is similar to it, this technique is identical to how the illusion of movement is achieved with television and motion pictures.
</p>
<p>
3D animation:object, models, are built on the computer monitor and 3D figures are controlled by a virtual skeleton.
</p>
<p>
3D animation, all frames must be rendered after the modeling is complete.
</p>
<p>
2D animation: separate object(illustrations) and separate transparent layers are used with or without a virtual skeleton.
</p>
<p>
2D animation, the rendering process is the key frame illustration process, while tweened frames are rendered as needed.
</p>
<p>
The facial features and outlook, including limbs eyes mouth clothes…, are moved by the animator on key frames. Then the differences between key frames are automatically calculated by the computer which known as Tweening/Morphing, and then the animation will be rendered.
Tweening/Morphing: a computer method that is used to make one image gradually change into a different one.
</p>
<p>
For pre-recording, rendered frames will be transferred to a different format or medium, such as digital video, or rendered in real time as they are presented to the audience.
To trick the eye and brain into thinking they are seeing a smoothly moving object, pictures should be drawn at around 12 frames per second or faster, with rates above 75-120 frames per second. At rates below 12 frames per second, most people can detect the transformation associated with the drawing of new images that detracts from the illusion of realistic movement. Hand-drawn cartoon animation often uses 15 frames per second in order to save number of drawings needed, but usually accepted due to the stylized nature of cartoons. In order to produce more realistic imagery, computer animation demands higher frame rates.
</p>
<p>
3D animation system: First create a simplified representation of a character’s skeleton or stick figure. The postion of each part of the model will be defined as animation variables, so called Avars.

Bias in CGI
</p>
<p>
After researching online, there were more bias on the concept of “animation”, instead of Computer Graphics. There were still many people relate animation to childhood, and exclude the depth in it. This acknowledgement is different also between different nations. As far as I know, in China, many older generations still assume animation is childish, naive, no-nutrition. This is understandable, because right now in China, many of CG animation including 2D and 3D are for children. The CG animation used in movie and games are gradually improving in recent years, yet still immature. This also have some relation to the special situation of China’s political direction.
